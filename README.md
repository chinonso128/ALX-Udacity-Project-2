**WeRateDogs Twitter Archive - ACT REPORT**
The WeRateDogs Twitter archive consists of data gathered from the @dog_rates twitter
account posted between November 2015 to August 2017. A total of 2356 tweets were
extracted from 5000 tweets.
The data has been wrangled and eight quality issues as well as two tidiness issues were
identified and sorted. After the four steps associated with the wrangling process, the data
was analysed and visualised. Three insights and one visualisation were produced.
